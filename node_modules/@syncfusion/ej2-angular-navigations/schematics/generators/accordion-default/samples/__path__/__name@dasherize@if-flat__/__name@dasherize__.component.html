                <div>Microsoft ASP.NET is a set of technologies in the Microsoft .NET Framework for building Web
                    applications and XML Web
                    services. ASP.NET pages execute on the server and generate markup such as HTML, WML, or XML that is
                    sent to a desktop
                    or mobile browser. ASP.NET pages use a compiled,event-driven programming model that improves
                    performance and enables
                    the separation of application logic and user interface.</div>

            <ng-template #content>
                <div>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main
                    components: the model,
                    the view, and the controller. The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an alternative to the ASP.NET Web
                    Forms pattern for
                    creating Web applications. The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation
                    framework that
                    (as with Web Forms-based applications) is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master
                    pages and membership-based
                    authentication.

            <ng-template #content>
                <div>JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language.It was originally implemented as
                    part of web browsers
                    so that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate
                    asynchronously, and alter
                    the document content that was displayed.More recently, however, it has become common in both game
                    development and
                    the creation of desktop applications.</div>
